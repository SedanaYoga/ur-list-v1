urList, which stands for **ur**gent **list**, is a project that was intended to simplify my work. As a test analyst, I had to memorize a lot of accounts, commandline, notes from seniors, etc. So, I created this to make it easier to see/retrieve my data. I know, don't judge me, I don't care, can't wait for the final result ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Motivation

I'm too lazy to copy paste my note from notepad or other useless app.
